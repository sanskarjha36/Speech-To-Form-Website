# Speech-To-Form-Website
In this project I have used flutter (Front-end) and Local App State (As Backend). The website can be use to Fill various types of forms. Right Now it only has "START LENGTH" "STOP LENGTH" "DEFECT" "SEVERITY" and download the excel file that has the values of these fields. Follow up the README file to know exactly how to set this up and try it out.

Run the code in VS Code.

# Very Important: The first thing you need to do is Run "Flutter pub get"  in the terminal (you can do this in VS code's terminal) and after that run the main file and it should open a local host where you can test it. If you forget to do this, the website will not function properly.

Cheers :)
