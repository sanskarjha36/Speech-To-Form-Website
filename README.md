# Speech-To-Form-Website
In this project I have used flutter (Front-end) and Local App State (As Backend). The website can be use to Fill various types of forms. Right Now it only has "START LENGTH" "STOP LENGTH" "DEFECT" "SEVERITY" and download the excel file that has the values of these fields. Follow up the README file to know exactly how to set this up and try it out.
